# TOP-mini-message-board
Live: https://wandering-lake-7690.fly.dev/
This is a basic messaging board app, intended to develop skill and understanding of several backend concepts technologies; ExpressJS, MongoDB for the database, and Fly.io for deployment and hosting. 
Along the way, I learned how to use .env files to hide sensitive data, Pug.js to render HTML at specific routes, and several Node packages necessary for the project. These include:

- express: the Node web framework for developing backend projects. 
- express-generator: used to generate an Express application skeleton.
- mongoose: used to connect to MongoDB, and to create Schemas to populate database fields.
- express-async-handler: used to reduce the boilerplate code for asynchronous functions.
- express-validator: used to validate and sanitize data.
- dotenv: used to hide sensitive data in environment variables.
